# Hexavalent

Hexavalent is a security-focused web browser based on Chromium.

## Why Was This Made?

*   Linux distributions can be a mess. They don't package it properly.
*   Existing packages are slow to update.
*   To provide a reference for people who want to package Chromium.
*   No "untouched" chromium with auto updates exists for Windows.

## Aims

*   Use Clang/LLVM to compile Chromium as upstream intends.
*   Use official builds only.
*   Compile with modern security features that upstream provides.
*   Be easy to maintain, clean, quick and efficient.
*   Fast updates â€” no more than 4 days lag time ideally.
*   TODO: Leverage the Windows hypervisor platform on Windows.
